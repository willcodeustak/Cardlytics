<h1> Brief Walkthrough</h1>

> (Just a heads up - I am not a financial advisor. You could totally just go to TCGplayer or similar sites and copy/paste recent sales into an AI chatbot yourself then prompt a request to aggregate. I basically just wanted to skip that whole website-visiting step.)

- You‚Äôll need to generate an **eBay OAuth token** and place it in your `.env` file.

# Setting Up Google Sheets Functionality

## Create a Google Cloud Project

- Go to https://console.cloud.google.com and create a new project (or use an existing one).
- Use the search bar to find and enable the **Google Drive API** and **Google Sheets API**.  
  _You don‚Äôt need to enter payment info._

## Enable APIs

- Make sure both **Google Drive API** and **Google Sheets API** are enabled for your project.

## Create a Service Account

- Go to **IAM & Admin ‚Üí Service Accounts**.
- Click **Create Service Account**, give it a name (e.g., `sheets-access`).
- After creating it, go to the **Keys** tab ‚Üí **Add Key** ‚Üí **JSON**.
- This will download a `.json` file - this is your credentials file.

## Save the Credentials File

- Move the downloaded file to your project directory (e.g., `src/google_credentials.json`).

* **Important:** Add it to your `.gitignore` to avoid uploading it to GitHub.

## Give the Bot Access to a Google Sheet

- Open the JSON file and find the `client_email` value.
- Create a new Google Sheet and share it with that email, giving it **edit access**.

## Add Your Email to the `.env` File

- In your `.env`, set the email you want the sheet shared with: `GOOGLE_SHEETS_SHARE_EMAIL` = yourname@gmail.com
- This email will receive access to any Sheets created by the app.

## üê≥ Run the App (After Setup Is Complete)

```bash
## üê≥ Docker Setup

# Build the image
docker build -t pokemon-prices .
# ^ Create a Docker image from current directory using Dockerfile

# Run the container
docker run -it --env-file .env pokemon-prices
# ^ -it lets you interact with the terminal (needed for input prompts)
# ^ --env-file loads environment variables from .env
```

<h2>Price Summary</h2>

> We still ensure every item appears in the results‚Äîeven if its condition is missing. Missing data should not cause an item to be excluded if it fits the search parameters.

<h2>Comparison Between Cardlytics and PriceCharting </h2>

> Data sets vary, I am ok with the range for now > see utils.py for 'filter_outliers_group'.
> Learned about IQR-based Outlier Detection or IQR Filtering logic.

> (Think of it as cutting off the lowest lows and highest highs that are unusually far from the middle). Interesting stuff.
